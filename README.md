# jira-action

GitHub Action for integrating [Jira][1] with your CI/CD pipeline. It allows you to automate the transition of Jira issues based on events in your GitHub repository, such as creating a branch, pushing a commit, opening a pull request, or merging a pull request. This helps streamline your development workflow by keeping your Jira issues up-to-date with the latest changes in your codebase.

## Motivation

Since there is no official Jira API integration with GitHub Action available online, and considering that Jira now has both [Cloud][5] and [Data Center][1] versions with different API implementations, this project will initially focus on the [Data Center][1] version. This will allow friends who have purchased the enterprise version to achieve automatic integration of Jira Issue status adjustments through CI/CD.

The motivation behind this project is to provide a simple way to integrate Jira with GitHub or Gitea Actions for JIRA Data Center.
